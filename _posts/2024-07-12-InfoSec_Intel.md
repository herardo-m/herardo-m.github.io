## Intelligence: 

The concept of data and information as fundamental components of intelligence is not novel. The term "intelligence" itself originates from the Latin nouns "intelligentia" or "intellÄ“ctus", derived from the verb "intelligere", meaning to comprehend or perceive. What is relatively new, however, is the unprecedented accessibility and leverage potential of data and information as a strategic resource.

For an information security leader, the most powerful asset is the ability to convert data and information into near real-time intelligence. This intelligence serves as a cornerstone for informed decision-making, process improvement and automation, control assurance and enhancements, and resource planning. An information security strategy that fails to incorporate intelligence risks compromising visibility and adequate protection of business-critical services and operations.

In today's rapidly evolving cyber landscape, intelligence-driven security is not merely an advantage, it is an imperative. 

Leaders who harness the power of data-driven insights position their organizations to proactively address emerging risks, optimize resource allocation, and align security initiatives with overarching business objectives."

## Framework:

How can we effectively gather data and information for a comprehensive information security intelligence program? While traditional research often yields results focused on threat intelligence (undoubtedly a crucial pillar), our objective is to integrate intelligence more broadly into information security strategy. This expanded approach encompasses decision support, metrics, and key performance indicators.

By mastering the the trifecta of data gathering, manipulation, and analytics, we transform advanced security information into a force multiplier for both daily operations and program management. This strategic approach yields multifaceted benefits:

1. Enhanced business effectiveness
2. Strengthened security posture
3. Increased program transparency
4. Improved overall effectiveness management

The key lies in developing a holistic view of information security intelligence that transcends the narrow focus on threats. By leveraging data across all aspects of our security program, we create a robust framework that not only defends against threats but also drives strategic decision-making and operational excellence.

This comprehensive intelligence strategy enables us to anticipate challenges, optimize resource allocation, and align security initiatives with overarching business objectives. In essence, it transforms information security from a reactive function into a proactive, value-driving component of our organization.

## Methdology:

The approach is to adopt the data science methodology outlined by John Rollins of IBM:

By leveraging the data science methdology, we can leverage models to understand, analyze, predict or even presribe activities to the advanced information security intelligence program. Here are the questions the data science methdology aims to answer:

From problem to approach (Business Understanding > Analytic Approach):
1. What si the problem you are trying to solve?
2. How can you use data to answer the question?

Working with the data (Data Requirements > Data Collection > Data Understanding > Data Preparation):
3. What data do you need to answer the question?
4. Where is the data coming from and how will you get it?
5. Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
6. What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?

Deriving the answer (Modeling > Evaluation > Deployment > Feedback):
7. In what way can the data be visualized to get to the answer that is required?
8. Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?
9. Can you put the model into practice?
10. Can you get constructive feedback into answering the question?

These questions help drive us through the data science methodology and gets us one step closer to maturing the advanced information security intelligence program.
