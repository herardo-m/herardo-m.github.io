## Professional Development:
I am currently pursuing the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) practical exam, so I can become a CEH Master. The journey is enhancing my ethical hacking skills by leveraging some of the same tools and techniques used by adversaries to discover, enumerate, exploit, and compromise target systems. 

In addition to pursing my CEH Master, I am also in the process of completing the IBM Data Science Professional certificate. This course is providing me practical knowledge of the Data Science Methodology and how to apply it by leverage data science tools, languages, and libraries to provide data insights into information security problems.         

After completing the CEH Master (target is end of summer 2024), I plan on starting my journey towards obtaining my Bachelor of Science - Cybersecurity and Information Assurance degree.
