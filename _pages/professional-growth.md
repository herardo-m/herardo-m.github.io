## Professional Growth:
Herardo is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (target is by end of Spring 2025). 

In addition to the Bachelor of Science degree, Herardo is also pursuing the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) practical exam and is working on completing the Coursera IBM Data Science Professional certificate.

The journey to becoming a CEH Master is enhancing his ethical hacking skills by leveraging some of the same tools and techniques used by adversaries to discover, enumerate, exploit, and compromise target systems. While the journey in completing the Coursera IBM Data Science Professional certificate is providing him with practical knowledge of the Data Science Methodology and how to apply it by leveraging data science tools, languages, and libraries to provide data insights into information security problems.
